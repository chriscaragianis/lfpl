<h2><a name="history" id="history"></a>History</h2>

  <p>The City of Jeffersontown has had a public library for most          of this century. On May 11, 1911, a library, sponsored by the Current Events Club, was          started in a &quot;newly papered and painted&quot; room of the Bruce Building on          Jeffersontown's historic Town Square. In 1917, the library received books from the Main          Library and was moved to the town bank. From 1917 to 1938, it relocated to various          locations, including private homes, and was staffed by volunteers. </p>
  <p> In 1939, the library          moved to the Municipal Building and later the WPA Recreation Center, the librarians being          paid by the Woman's Club. After relocating to the old Jeffersontown High School, the          library was closed for four years. It reopened in          1948 on the back porch of Betty Elswick's home. After a stay at this location, the library moved to an annex of the          Presbyterian Church, and in 1962 it moved to the Jeffersontown Shopping Center and became          part of the Louisville Free Public Library system. From here, the library relocated in          1970 to Colonial Manor, a former county home for the poor. </p>
  <p>The  library operated in Colonial Manor until 1994, when the branch returned to the  shopping center while a new library was constructed. The new branch library was  built next to Colonial Manor, and the $1.5 million branch opened on January 29,  1996. The 14,000-square-foot building features a wing devoted to children's and teen's services and materials, an adult  reference area with more than twenty computers, a  meeting room available for public use,  and a comfortable reading area awash with  natural light. The Jeffersontown Museum, under separate management,  occupies the south side of the structure.</p>
