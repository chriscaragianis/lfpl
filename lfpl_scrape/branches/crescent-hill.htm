<h2><a name="history" id="history"></a>History</h2>

  <p> The Crescent Hill Branch, constructed in 1908, was one of the          first of nine Carnegie-endowed libraries in the City of Louisville. Designed by the local          architectural firm of Thomas and Bohne, it is an excellent example of Beaux-Arts          architecture. The library building has been adapted over time, but the architectural          integrity remains. An addition to the west side of the building was added in 1961, with a          renovation in 1988. </p>
  <p>The building underwent a major renovation in the early 1990s. During the          renovation, the library was temporarily housed in the Masonic Home on Frankfort Ave. On          March 24, 1994, the library reopened with a gala reception. Led by local designer, Dwight          Cobb, the result is an elegant, stately building with breathtaking interior design. The          building is handicapped accessible, and houses two floors of library services,          reading/study areas with comfortable seating and lighting, a meeting room, and a          periodicals room. The  signature piece of the Library is the Children's wing, complete with a mural of  children's literary characters and a castle (turret and all). &nbsp;&nbsp;One  of the Library’s two handsome reading rooms was recognized in 2007 by <u>USA  Today</u> as one of the top 10 reading rooms in American public libraries. </p>
  <p>    The  Library has a long tradition of involvement in the community. Sallie T.  Berryman, who served as the librarian from 1909-1939, organized the first story  hour, night classes, boy's and girl's clubs, a child health clinic, and two  groups that would later become the Crescent Hill Women's Club. A memorial to  Crescent Hill residents killed in World War I was dedicated in 1922. 
    The  Library remains actively involved in its community and celebrated its 100th  anniversary in 2008.</p>
