    <p> Kindergarten Countdown is a  partnership between Metro United Way, Louisville Metro, LFPL,&nbsp;JCPS, and  PNC Bank with support from cultural and educational institutions throughout the  county.&nbsp; The goal of Kindergarten Countdown is to support children's  transitions into kindergarten.</p>
    <p><strong>Kindergarten Countdown begins June  1</strong>, for all children  entering kindergarten this fall. Simply visit any Louisville Free Public Library on or after June 1st and pick up your "I'm going to  Kindergarten" t-shirt and free book.  The t-shirt will get the child  and one parent into Kindergarten Countdown events around the city all summer  long - free! The Countdown culminates July 28 at Slugger Field with  a Kindergarten Countdown Fair and Louisville Bats game. </p>

    </h2>
    <p>Experts say that children need to hear 1,000 stories before  they begin to learn to read.
Read 3 stories each day; a favorite one, an old one, and a  new one. Reading the same book three times counts, too. In one year, your child  will have heard over 1,000 stories! Check out this booklist  for great books  to share with your children: <strong><a href="http://www.lfpl.org/kids/pdf/100-Books-to-Read-Kgarten.pdf">100 Books to Read  Before Kindergarten.</a> </strong><br />

    <p><a name="Scissors" id="Scissors"></a><strong><u>Basic Skill - Cutting with scissors</u></strong><br />
    Children need to be able to cut to  complete their work at school. The easiest way to help children learn to cut is  to give them safe scissors, some scrap paper, and basic directions on how to  hold the scissors. Just let them find their way with the scissors and paper.  Once you see they are doing okay with simple cuts, use a marker to make lines on  paper for them to follow.</p>
    <p>Junk mail is great for children to  practice cutting! You may want to cut sheets of junk mail into smaller pieces,  easy for small hands to hold, approximately 3 x 5 inches. You can buy child scissors  for a little more that $1 at many stores. </p>
    <p><strong><u><a name="Songs-Rhymes" id="Scissors2"></a>Songs/Action Rhymes</u></strong><br />
    Research has shown that by singing and  chanting action rhymes, children learn to hear the individual sounds that, when  put together, form words. This skill will help your child in future years when  they begin reading. </p>

    <p><strong><u><a name="Reading" id="Scissors3"></a>Early Reading Activity</u></strong><br />
      When your child knows  a story so well that he/she can use the pictures in the story as clues to tell  it, your child is showing you an early form of reading. Indulge your child when  he/she asks you to &quot;Read it again!&quot; and use some of these suggestions to build  on your child's early reading skills: <strong><a href="documents/read-it-again.pdf">&quot;Read It Again&quot; </a></strong><br />
    </p>
    <p><strong><u><a name="Writing" id="Scissors4"></a>Early Writing Activity</u></strong><br />
    A skill that is helpful for your  child to know when starting kindergarten is how to hold a pencil, crayon, pen  or marker. Fat crayons and markers are easier for small hands to hold.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>TREASURE CHEST</strong><br />
      Help your child make a treasure chest  of things he/she loves. Tape a box shut and cut a whole in the top. Help your  child spell his/her first name, add ('s) [Ex. LISA'S or JACOB'S)] and the words  &quot;TREASURE CHEST.&quot; Your child will draw a  picture of an object, label it and add it to his/her treasure chest. Let your  child write the word, but help with spelling. Here are some examples of  treasures: foods (for each meal), toys, books, places you go, family members,  friends, activities (for every season).</p>
      <p><u>What you need</u>: plain white  or colored paper, 8-color box of markers or crayons, scissors, glue stick and  other items to decorate.</p>

    <p><strong><u><a name="Math-Science" id="Scissors5"></a>Early Math and Science Concepts</u></strong><br />
    Young children learn by exploring the  world around them in many different ways, as long as we adults don't stifle  them. As tricky as it can be sometimes, allow children to ask questions. Then  you and your child can find the answers together. Sometimes if you let them,  they might just teach you better ways to learn things. You can see children  using skills of science and math when they:</p>
    <ul><li>Repeat actions over  and over (working the same puzzle)</li>
      <li>Lift things up and look under them (looking  under rocks)</li>
      <li>Ask questions (Why does that cloud look like a  bear?)</li>
      <li>Use materials and tools in creative ways (use  yarn to measure height of block structure)</li>
      <li>Watch things closely (observing the fish in the  tank)</li>
      <li>Make a guess (Where does an animal live?  What will it do next?)</li>
      <li>Solve problems (putting together puzzles,  building a stronger tower after the first three fell)</li>
      <li>Represent real objects (The building block  becomes a train, a car, a rocket ship)</li>
      <li>Compare objects (covering small baby with a small  blanket, larger baby with larger blanket)</li>
      <li>Sort objects (Sorting buttons into groups by  color, size, shape, metal/plastic, etc.)</li>
      <li>Pretend play (act out an activity that was  discussed in a story)</li>
    </ul>

      <p><strong><u><a name="math" id="Scissors11"></a>Math Activities</u><u></u></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Counting</strong>: Children must learn their  numbers as sure as the sun rises and 
sets. Start counting snaps on  pajamas, buttons on shirts, and socks on feet. Count Cheerios in a bowl, bites  of cereal per bowl, and kisses on cheeks. Counting can happen anywhere and it  can be free, free, free!! </p>
      <p>Another fun activity is to make  number books. You can make a book for each number. Start with a book called ONE.  On each page make one object: one tree, one dog, one kiss, one flower, etc.  Your children can draw an object, then fill it in using crayons/markers or by gluing  down macaroni, yarn or colored paper. Your children could also cut out pictures  from old magazines or newspaper ads. The sky's the limit. Next, make a TWO book.  On each page make two of the same type of object. </p>
      <p><u>What you need</u>: Crayons, paper,  scissors and glue. </p>
      <p><strong>Shapes:</strong> Start simple and move up. Talk  about the basic shapes, pointing 
out different  items in everyday conversation. &quot;Joseph, this is a square 
block. Do you see  another square block?&quot; &quot;Max, these saltine crackers are 
rectangles. Now  let's break it in half! We have two squares now!!&quot; (that 
depends on the  brand!)</p>
      <p>Circle (pizza,  cracker, bowl); square (cracker, block, television screen); 
        triangle (tent,  hat, yield sign); rectangle (block, window, pant leg). Go for 
        shape walks and  see all the different shapes around you. Turn off 
        the cell phone and  engage in your child. </p>

      <p><strong><u><a name="science" id="Scissors12"></a>Science Activities</u></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Water play:</strong> Water play starts as early  as the first bath with baby. As long 
as babies feels safe during their  bath time they will love playing in the water, building skills as their minds grow.  Given tools to work with (toys in child speak) they can make magic in the tub  using bowls, spoons, cups, and squeeze toys in many different ways. As the  adult, you get to watch the play and join in! Does this sink? Does this float? Does  this hold water? Show how to pour from one object to another. Which cup holds more?  You can even talk about how the water was warm and now it is cold. Discuss the  sound of water as it pours from different heights. </p>
      <p><strong>Science Lab in the Tub:</strong> (This is the  name we give to tub play with <br />
        clothes on!! The  Science Lab in the Tub came about when it was actually 
        too hot to play outside!) You'll  need a giant bowl for holding water, plastic measuring cups of different sizes,  measuring spoons, bowls, a turkey baster, sponges, imagination and towels for  cleaning up!! The act of cleaning up is a life skill that we all must learn.  Let the scientist help you!</p>
      <p><strong>The Act of Measuring: </strong>Something we  didn't learn to do as children was 
        to measure without a ruler or yard  stick. Children today are learning to measure in different ways to help expand  their minds. You can talk about measuring simply by seeing how many of your  child's feet equal your feet? Two or three of your child's foot is the same  size as one of Daddy's feet! How incredible is that? Use wooden blocks to  measure doorways. Lie down on the floor and see how many wooden blocks long your  child is from head to toe. Measure Mommy and Daddy too. If you have tile on  your kitchen floor, measure the length of your child in floor tiles. </p>
      <p><strong>Sorting:</strong> The simple act of sorting  starts with picking up toys and putting 
        pairs of socks  together. This is how simple this can be to practice. Turn a 
        chore into a game  and it is all good! </p>
      <p><strong>Sock Sort:</strong> Sit with your child and that  awful basket of socks that never 
        gets sorted!! Make  a game of putting all the blue socks together, then find 
        the red, then the  white, etc. See how many pairs you can find together.</p>
      <p><strong>Toy Sort:</strong> Sort toys using categories:  blocks, Legos, action figures, dolls, 
        etc. You can sort  in different sets by color, size, soft/hard, etc. </p>

    <p><strong><u><a name="Movement" id="Scissors6"></a>Movement Activities</u></strong></p>
    <p><a href="http://www.nih.gov/"><strong>The National Institute of Health</strong></a><br />
      Most children need at least an hour of movement every day. Regular  exercise helps children:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Feel less stressed </li>
      <li>Feel better about themselves </li>
      <li>Feel more ready to learn in school </li>
      <li>Keep a healthy weight </li>
      <li>Build and keep healthy bones, muscles  and joints </li>
      <li>Sleep better at night </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Basic Movements to Exercise the Body  and the Brain</strong><br />
      The  brain is divided into a left and right side. Movement helps both sides of the  brain work together. </p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Swinging  and hopping help develop balance and make children aware of the space around  them.</li>
        <li>Walking,  running, marching, skipping, climbing and throwing balls are all cross-body  movements which help both sides of the brain work together.</li>
        <li>Dancing  develops listening skills, rhythm, timing, and makes children aware of the  space around them.</li>
        <li>Playing  with balls (bouncing, dribbling, throwing, catching &amp; rolling them) helps develop  hand-eye coordination, makes children aware of the space around them, and  develops timing (smaller balls move faster, larger ball move slower).</li>
        <li>Playing  with ropes (jumping rope, tug-of-war, climbing) develops balance and eye-foot  coordination.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u><a name="Storytelling" id="Scissors7"></a>Family Storytelling</u></strong><br />
    Storytelling is a great way to bond  with family members and learn about your cultural heritage. It also builds a  child's attention span and helps them learn the parts of a story. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><u>Instructions</u>: Use pictures  or objects to help spark memories from your childhood and/or the first few  years of your child's life. Give lots of details such as where it took place,  who was involved, what happened, and how it ended. Tell stories about something  that happened that made you laugh, scared, embarrassed or mad.<br />
      </p>
      <p><u>What you need</u>: <br />
