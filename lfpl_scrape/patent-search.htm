    <h1><a name="top" id="top"></a><strong>Searching United States Patents on the Internet</strong></h1>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>Do       I have access to all the United States Patents on the Internet?</strong></h3>
    <p>You have access to all United States patents (full text as  well as drawings) as well as access to all published United States patent applications  at <strong><a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">www.uspto.gov</a>. </strong></p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>I’m       not sure what a patent is?</strong></h3>
    <p>Good point! For a good overview of patents, go to<strong> <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/inventors/patents.jsp">Patents for Independent Inventors</a></strong>.   </p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>I don’t want to move off of this page.       How do stay on this site and get an overview of other types of       intellectual property like trademarks or copyright?</strong></h3>
    <p>Go the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">www.uspto.gov</a> and  look at the headings at the top of the page and click on <strong>Trademarks </strong>and then click on <strong><a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/trademarks/workflow/start.htm">Trademarks  Basics</a></strong>.  For copyright information you can go directly to the <strong><a href="http://www.copyright.gov/">U.S. Copyright Office</a></strong>.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>How       do I start my patent search?</strong></h3>
    <p>We recommend that you sit down and in your own words write a  description of your invention. Include how it is put together and emphasize how  this particular device is different from all the other devices out there.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>How       do I go online and begin searching the USPTO Website?</strong></h3>
    <p>First of all you have to make sure you have a <strong>“TIFF”</strong> program installed in your PC so you can see the patent drawings. You can access  a selection of TIFF programs (all at no cost) at <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/patft/help/images.htm">www.uspto.gov/patft/help/images.htm</a>.  Choose the TIFF program appropriate to your needs (Apple, Microsoft Windows, or  Linux). </p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>I’ve       got my TIFF program, so what do I do next?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
    <p>Go to <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/"><strong>www.uspto.gov</strong></a> and  click on the “<strong>Search Box” </strong>in the  upper right hand of the page and type in the words, <strong>uspc</strong> <strong>classification</strong>.  This step allows us to get into the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/uspcindex/indextouspc.htm"><strong>United States Patent Classification Index</strong></a>. </p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>What       do I do when I get to the Classification Index?</strong></h3>
    <p>Choose the term in the index that describes your invention.  In this example we are going to choose the term “bicycle” because our invention  is for bicycle handlebars. Clicking on the letter B in the classification index  and then clicking on “bicycle” we come across the sub-heading “handlebars”  under the <strong>class number 74</strong> <strong>(machine  element or mechanism)</strong> and the <strong>subclass 551+ (folding or adjustable  handlebars).</strong>       We need to click on these class and subclass numbers because  we seem to be dealing with a <strong>utility patent</strong>. How do we know this? We  know this because we don’t see the letter <strong>D</strong> in front of the class  number, indicating a design patent.  For  a good description and review of the different kinds of patents, go back to the <strong><a href="http://www.uspto.gov/inventors/patents.jsp">Patents for Independent</a></strong> <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/inventors/patents.jsp"><strong>Inventors</strong></a><strong> </strong>page.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>OK, why do I have to click on the       class and subclass numbers when I’m searching utility patents?</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We need to click on those class and subclass numbers in  order to read the <strong>definitions</strong>, so we  can tell if we are searching in the right subject matter. Let’s click on class  number 74 and subclass 551+ to see what the definitions tell us. Because class  551 has a plus sign after it, we know that there are several subclass numbers  that follow. When we click on the number we see that 551.3 is especially  interesting. 551.3 indicates that the handlebars are foldable or adjustable  relative to the post, and the handlebars we want to patent are foldable.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>How do I see the individual patents       and patent applications for foldable handlebars?</strong></h3>
    <p>When we clicked on class 74 and subclass 551.3 we noticed a <strong>“red P”</strong> to the left of the number.  Click on that red P and you will see a list of patents for foldable bicycle  handlebars in the <strong>USPTO Patent Full-Text  and Image Database.  </strong>Click on the  first patent listed and look at the text. Don’t forget to check the patent  applications as well as the granted patents. To find <strong>patent applications</strong> for this class and subclass click on the <strong>“blue A” </strong>to the left of the 551.3 for a  list of current applications on foldable handlebars. It is important to search  both granted patents and patent applications when you are researching your  invention.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>What should I be paying attention to       when I look at the patent?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
    <ul type="disc">
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>Look        at the <strong>Current U.S. Class</strong> field. If there are several class and subclass numbers here, you probably        want to check the definitions and patents under these numbers.<strong></strong></li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li>Look        at the <strong>Current International Class</strong> and soon to be universal, the <strong>Cooperative        Patent Classification System field</strong>. If you want to broaden your        search to current United States patents (January 1, 2013--) as well as foreign        patents, these class numbers will help your search in the appropriate        subject matter. To brush up your skills in understanding the mysteries of        the <strong>Cooperative Patent        Classification System</strong>, visit the ECLA search utility at: <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/eclasrch?locale=en_EP&amp;classification=ecla">http://worldwide.espacenet.com/eclasrch?locale=en_EP&amp;classification=ecla</a>.        What exactly is the Cooperative Patent Classification System? It is a        bilateral system which has been jointly developed by the <strong>European Patent</strong> <strong>Office (EPO)</strong> and the <strong>United States Patent and Trademark        Office</strong> <strong>(USPTO),</strong> combining        the best classification practices of the two offices. Translation: we        better get used to it. The good news is that we can translate the United        States Patent Classification System classification numbers into the        Cooperative Classification System classification numbers by visiting <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/">www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/</a> and clicking on the USPC bubble and choosing USPC. Then we choose <strong>Statistical Mapping from</strong> <strong>USPTO to CPC</strong> in the <strong>Select Content Box</strong>. One of the        classification numbers that should come up is B62K 21/16. This CPC number        is a close match to the USPTO class and subclass 74/551+. Use the CPC        class numbers to find U.S. patents as well as European patents, and don’t        be afraid to plug in those CPC codes in a Google advanced patent search: <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> and type in “advanced        patent search” to find American as well as foreign patents.<strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <ol start="3" type="1">
        <li>Look        at the <strong>Field of Search. </strong>These        are the class and subclass numbers the Patent Examiner has checked.<strong></strong></li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <ol start="4" type="1">
        <li>Look        for <strong>References Cited </strong>and click        on the patent numbers of other inventions that influenced this particular        invention.<strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <ol start="5" type="1">
        <li>Look        at the <strong>Claims</strong> of this        invention. What are claims, you ask? Check out the <strong>glossary</strong> section of the USPTO Website at <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/main/glossary/index.html">www.uspto.gov/main/glossary/index.html</a> for definitions of the patent and trademark terms you don’t know.        According to the glossary, <strong>claims        define the invention and are what aspects are legally enforceable.</strong></li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <ol start="6" type="1">
        <li>Pay        attention to the <strong>prior </strong>or <strong>related art</strong> sections of your        patent. <strong>Prior art usually is        interpreted as the state of knowledge publicly available either before        the date of your invention or more than one year prior to your earliest        patent application date (</strong>Section 102 of the patent law paraphrased).        To get a patent, your invention must be novel. If it has been hanging        around in the public or on the market for too long, you will not be        granted a patent.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <ol start="7" type="1">
        <li>Pay        attention to the <strong>description of        the drawings</strong>, so you have an idea of how you will describe the        drawings of your invention.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <ol start="8" type="1">
        <li>Look        at the <strong>detailed description of the        preferred embodiments. </strong>What is a preferred embodiment? The USPTO        glossary tells us that the embodiment is <strong>“the manner in which an invention can be made, used, practiced,        or expressed.” </strong>Remember, as the inventor, you must make a full        disclosure of the best uses for your invention, and the embodiment        section is where you can accomplish this goal. </li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>I’ve       been reading and reading the patent and I have no idea what this invention       is about. How do I get to look at the drawings?</strong></h3>
    <p>Now you can understand why we made a fuss about the<strong> TIFF</strong> program. If you have a TIFF program installed, you will have no problem  accessing the drawings. Just go to the top of your screen and click on <strong>Images. </strong>Notice the <strong>Full Text Help </strong>prompt to the left of the patent. You can  navigate and print the patent and drawings one page at a time.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>What       do I do if I can’t find a term for my invention in the Index to the U.S.       Patent Classification System?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
    <p>Go back to your <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/patft/index.html"><strong>Patent Search</strong> </a><strong>page</strong>   and look at your <strong>Quick Search</strong> and <strong>Advanced Search</strong> options. <strong>Caution! </strong>Word searches in the USPTO Website only cover patents issued after 1975.  For word search coverage for older patents, you can go to <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_patent_search">GOOGLE Patents</a></strong>. 
    Click on advanced search, and try a word search. <strong>Caution!  Word searches are very imprecise.  </strong>Once  you find a patent that is similar to your invention, immediately examine the  classes and subclasses attached to that patent, and do a new search using these  numbers. Note: GOOGLE has a nice bridge to the USPTO Website on each patent  listed in the GOOGLE patents site.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>What’s an easy way to plug in those class and subclass numbers, so I can do a       patent search on the USPTO Website?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
    <p>Go to the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/"><strong>Access Classification Info Symbol</strong></a> page  and click on the USPC (United States Patent Classification) button and plug in  your class and subclass numbers in the appropriate search boxes. Choose either <strong>Schedule </strong>or <strong>Definitions </strong>in the <strong>Select  Content Box</strong>, and click on the submit button. You are now on your way to a  much more thorough search of your invention.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>Is       it necessary to search patent applications as well as issued patents?</strong></h3>
    <p>In a word, <strong>yes! </strong>Don’t ever  forget to check the patent applications as well as the granted patents. To find <strong>patent applications</strong> for this class  and subclass click on the <strong>“blue A” </strong>to  the left of the 551.3 in in the <strong><a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/uspc074/sched074.htm#C074S551100">United  States Patent Classification Schedule</a></strong>   for a list of current applications on foldable handlebars. It is always important  to search both granted patents and patent applications when you are researching  your invention.
    Remember that we have  to pay attention to prior art, and patent applications count as prior art. </p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>Would it help to broaden my search by       looking up patents on foreign websites?</strong></h3>
    <p>The broader the search, the better off you are in  establishing whether your item is indeed new and different and thus eligible to  be patented. Go to <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">www.uspto.gov</a> and go to  the upper right-hand corner of the site to <strong>FAQs. </strong>Click on FAQs and choose <strong><a href="http://www.uspto.gov/faq/other.jsp">Other Web Resources</a></strong>.  Here you need to choose <strong>Other  Intellectual Property</strong> <strong>Offices.</strong> Don’t  expect to find the same level of detail when you search the foreign patent  sites. Only the United States Patent Office offers full text and drawings for  all United States patents. No free or commercial foreign patent website offers  this kind of coverage for both its historical and current patents.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3><strong>Are       there any local workshops to help me with my patent search?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
